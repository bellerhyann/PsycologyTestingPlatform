    <h1>Logic and Phase Progression</h1>
    <p>
        Upon completion of each phase <br> <br>
        <!--If (phasepassed ) print "Great work! Click the button when your ready for the next phase"-->
        <!--(Phase = Phase +1) button appears which leads back to Question.php-->
        <!--If (!phasepased) print "Thank you for your participation, your done with this lab" -->

        <br> <br> <b>Pretraining </b> Logic in html file.<br>
        needs 8 consecutive trials<br>
        <!-- int i = 0;bool phasepassed = false; if (i = 7){phasepassed = true}; if (trial < correct){i++};if (trial > incorrect){i = 0};-->

        <br> <br> <b>Symmetry pretest</b>  <br>
        needs below (67%) on each block to continue<br>
        If any block is above 67%, discontinue<br>
        <!--    -->
        <br><br> <b>Transitivity pretest</b> <br>
        needs below (67%) on each block to continue<br>
        If any block is above 67%, discontinue<br>
        <!--    -->
        <br> <br> <b>Baseline training</b>   <br>
        needs:<br>
        Prompt (“Click”) at 4 seconds after white box appears only during go trials<br>
        2 blocks at 100% without prompting to continue to testing<br>
        Up to 24 blocks to meet criterion, if not discontinuez<br>


        <br> <br> <b>Baseline test</b>   <br>
        needs:<br>
        1 block at 100% to continue <br>
        If below 100%, return to baseline training <br>
        criterion is not met within 24 blocks, discontinue (note: 24 blocks means cumulative total from first baseline training and return to baseline training)<br>

        If participant meets criterion within 24 blocks during return to baseline training, progress to baseline test <br>
        If participant scores below 100% on baseline test again, discontinue <br>

        <br> <br> <b>Symmetry Test</b> <br>
        needs
        No points/sounds from computer and no prompting

        22/24 or above (92%) across 2 blocks, then progress to transitivity test

        As long as participant continue to have an increasing trend in percentages, continue to test until progression criterion is met

        If participants score below 92% at a stable (e.g., participant scores 80%, 81%, and 80% consecutively) or decreasing trend (e.g., participant scores 67%, 50%, and 42% consecutively) across three consecutive blocks, discontinue symmetry testing but still progress to transitivity testing

        <br> <br> <b>Transitivity Test</b> <br>
        needs

        No points/sounds from computer and no prompting<br>

        34/36 or above (94%) across 2 blocks<br>

        As long as participant continue to have an increasing trend in percentages, continue to test until criterion is met<br>

        Once criterion is met, conclude the session; If participants score below 94% at a stable
        <br>(e.g., participant scores 80%, 81%, and 80% consecutively) or decreasing trend
        <br>(e.g., participant scores 67%, 50%, and 42% consecutively) across three consecutive blocks,
        <br>discontinue and conclude the session
